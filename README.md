### Hi there 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! 🌟 I’m Diana, a passionate Computational Linguist diving deep into the realms of NLP and AI. Here's where I break down language barriers and build bridges with code.

🌱 My current research interest is in fact-checking within large language models (LLMs).

🛠️ **My Tactic:** Divide and conquer – I tackle complex language problems by breaking them down into manageable pieces.
