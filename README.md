### Hi there 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! 🌟 I’m Diana, a passionate Computational Linguist diving deep into the realms of NLP and AI. Here's where I break down language barriers and build bridges with code.

🗡️ **My Tactic:** Divide and conquer – I tackle complex language problems by breaking them down into manageable pieces.

👯 **I’m looking to collaborate on:**
   - Computational Linguistics Projects
   - NLP Research
   - Sexism Detection
   - Corpus Creation
   - Innovative AI Applications in Language Processing

💬 **Ask me about:**
   - CoRoSeOf: My corpus of Romanian sexist and offensive language.
   - The nitty-gritty of computational linguistics and natural language processing.
   - Strategies for sexism detection in text, corpus creation, and annotation.
   - How AI is reshaping the landscape of language models.

📫 **How to reach me:**
   - 📧 Email me at diana.hoefels@gmail.com
   - 🤝 Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/diana-hoefels-6668b776/)

😄 **Convo Starter:** Always here for a good chat about language, AI, or anything tech!

⚡ **Fun fact:** I built CoRoSeOf, a dataset aimed at training AI to recognize and address sexism in text. I believe in using the power of words for good!
